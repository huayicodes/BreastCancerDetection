# BreastCancerDetection - practicing a data challenge 
Classified highly imbalanced breast cancer biopsy results with a logistic regression model, explored what features contribute to malignancy, FP &amp; FN predictions.  

## The Questions: 
You've been tasked with developing a means to help doctors diagnose breast cancer. You've been given data about biopsied breast cells; where it is benign (not harmful) or malignant (cancerous).
-	What features of a cell are the largest drivers of malignancy? Build a model that predicts whether a given biopsied breast cell is benign or malignant.
-	What features drive your false positive rate for your model you derived above, what features drive your false negative rate? 
-	How would a physician use your product?
-	There is a non-zero cost in time and money to collect each feature about a given cell. How would you go about determining the most cost-effective method of detecting malignancy

## The Data: 
9 features (all range from 1-10) + Class (4 for benign, 2 for malignant)

Clump Thickness, Uniformity of Cell Size, Uniformity of Cell Shape, Marginal Adhesion,
Single Epithelial Cell Size,
Bare Nuclei,
Bland Chromatin,
Normal Nucleoli,
Mitoses

## My Approach:
- logistic regression model 
- used 3 methods to find features that best classify malignancy
- used statistical comparison methods to find features that drive false positive rate & false negative rate
